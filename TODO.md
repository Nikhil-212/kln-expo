# Voice Input Implementation TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create voice input JavaScript file (static/js/voice_input.js)
- [x] Update index.html template with voice input button and styling
- [x] Add Font Awesome icons and CSS for voice input button
- [x] Integrate Web Speech API for speech-to-text conversion
- [x] Add voice input button next to prompt textarea
- [x] Implement recording state with visual feedback (red button when recording)

## Features Implemented
- Voice input button with microphone icon
- Click to start/stop recording
- Automatic transcription to prompt textarea
- Visual feedback during recording (button color changes to red)
- Error handling for unsupported browsers
- Responsive design with Bootstrap classes

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test voice input in supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- [ ] Verify transcription accuracy
- [ ] Test form submission with voice-generated prompt
- [ ] Check browser compatibility (hide button if Web Speech API not supported)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Notes
- Uses Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) - works in Chrome, Edge, Safari
- No backend changes needed as existing prompt processing handles voice-transcribed text
- Button is hidden in unsupported browsers
- Default language set to English (en-US) but can be made configurable
